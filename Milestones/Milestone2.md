# Milestone 2 (7th May, 5pm)

## Introduction
Our project aims to visualize the evolution of movies across countries and over time. We aim to show in which countries most movies are produced and under which genre. We can develop further statistics around this main goal.

## Goals
### 1.1 Movies densities across countries:

An axample of a map that we tried to create is shown above.
It will be the our main visualization. we will work on adding the ability to select any country on click and showing as a result different statistics bases on that specific one. Some popus should be seen to make it as interactive as we would like it to be.

### 1.2 Year visualisation :
As seen in the above sketch we will try and use a toolbar for visualizing the movie industry evolution in time.
We would develop a nice desing for the choice of the time scale so that users can choose the year that they want to analyse.

### 1.3 Movies by Genre in Each country:
